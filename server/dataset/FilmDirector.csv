This was interrupted by military service in the army but only partly as he was put into the army film unit where he made over 100 films. Demobbed in 1960 he used family money for his first feature Le propre de l'homme (1961) which was a total flop. In '61 he started filming 'La Vie de Chateau' but was forced to close down after one week due to lack of finance. In 1964 he made L'amour avec des si (1964) which was a success in Sweden but a flop everywhere else. In 1963 his film La donna è uno spettacolo (1964) had 40 minutes cut by the censor so it was never shown publicly. His film Una ragazza e quattro mitra (1965) was his first to recover production costs. In 1965 came his 5th completed film Operazione Golden Car (1966) but he thought it so bad that he bought the film himself so that it would never be seen.

This film had shades of an Irwin Allen disaster movie, The Swarm (1978), about the outbreak of killer bees. Both films had the military and scientists clash, also both had choppers all over the place.Then came Air Force One (1997), about terrorists taking over the presidents plane. This film had shades of a 1970s Airport disaster film.The Perfect Storm (2000) came next, and while the script about a boat at sea in a storm was okay, the constant fake looking computer generated sea water damaged the film.And then came Poseidon (2006), about a passenger ship turning over at sea. Outbreak just hinted at being an Irwin Allen remake, but with Poseidon it was now official..this was a remake of Allen's The Poseidon Adventure (1972). The new Poseidon movie was Petersen's worst action/disaster movie by a long way. From casting to scripting the movie was terrible and our director made the same mistake seen in The Perfect Storm by having fake CGI sea water all over the place."

John attended Hampton Grammar School from approx 1960 to 1967, appearing as Macbeth in the school play in about 1966 complete with the normally banned long hair.As a teen he lived every boyhood dream, singing and playing bass in a rock and roll band called The Riots.In 1968 he took the ""ten pound"" opportunity offered by the Australian government and sailed to Australia with his guitar and a few pounds in his pocket. He worked on a sheep station before moving to Sydney, where he was working as a storeman by day and frontman of a cover band at night. He soon heard a US film called Adam's Woman, starring Beau Bridges, was being filmed in NSW and got a job as a grip on set. Cast members, including Helen Morse, recommended he try auditioning for an up and coming new musical. He did, and landed the lead role of Claude in Sydney's 1969 production of the landmark rock musical, Hair. This was followed by the role of Judas in Godspell.This led to an acting career on stage, film and television that elevated him to his current status as Australia's most versatile leading man.In order to appear a more mature actor, John added 5 years to his age in the early 70s. This, along with exciting stories of how he came to acquire the famous scar beneath his left eye (anything from sword fight in Algiers to bar brawls in Paris), enabled John to get many of the most sought after roles in Australia at the time.Articles in womens magazines had John celebrating his 40th birthday several years too early.

109592,811714,"Born in Milan, Italy in 1957, Michele Soavi's parents separated when he was little and he lived with his mother who remarried a painter. Interested in his stepfather's interest in painting, Soavi began an interest in creative arts in his school. During his teenage years, he decided that the cinema was his true calling after attending several movie screenings and developing a taste for acting. After graduating from high school, Soavi took acting lessons at Fersen Studios in Milan. His first acting role was an extra in the movie Bambulè (1979) which was directed by Marco Modugno. During production, Modugno, impressed by Soavi's interest in the movies, offered him a job as an assistant director which Soavi accepted and learned more about a director's film making technique. After acting in small roles in Il giorno del Cobra (1980) and Paura nella città dei morti viventi (1980), Soavi was given another chance as an assistant director by director Aristide Massaccesi (aka: Joe D'Amato). In their first film, Soavi acted in an uncredited part, and was the assistant director. Over four more films with Massaccesi, Soavi served as a bit part actor, screenwriter and personal assistant. Soavi first met writer/director Dario Argento in 1979 where the director took Soavi under his wing after learning of their same tastes with film making. Argento made Soavi the second assistant director for the movie Tenebre (1982) with Lamberto Bava as the first assistant director.Pleased with his work, Bava hired Soavi as his assistant director for the mystery"

Brisby e il segreto di Nimh (1982) was an animated film based on the children's book ""Mrs. Frisbee and the Rats of Nimh"". The film dealt with a widowed field mouse named Mrs. Brisbee and her plight to move her house before the farmer plants his field. The rats of Nimh, an organization of super intelligent rats, band together to help her. ""The Secret of NIMH"" was a visually ravishing film that hearkened back to the glory days of Disney. While animation buffs raved, the film did little business at the box office. (The growing number of VCR's in America would help the film reach a cult status on home video). Undaunted, Bluth persevered. He created the video games Dragon's Lair (1983) and Space Ace (1983), both of which allowed the player to control an actual cartoon. He later teamed up with Steven Spielberg for the films Fievel sbarca in America (1986) and Alla ricerca della valle incantata (1988).

13442,3638,"F.W. Murnau was a German film director. He was greatly influenced by Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, Shakespeare and Ibsen plays he had seen at the age of 12, and became a friend of director Max Reinhardt. During World War I he served as a company commander at the eastern front and was in the German air force, surviving several crashes without any severe injuries.One of Murnau's acclaimed works is the 1922 film Nosferatu, an adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. Although not a commercial success due to copyright issues with Stoker's novel, the film is considered a masterpiece of Expressionist film.He later emigrated to Hollywood in 1926, where he joined the Fox Studio and made three films: Sunrise (1927), 4 Devils (1928) and City Girl (1930). The first of these three is widely regarded as one of the greatest films ever made.In 1931 Murnau travelled to Bora Bora to make the film Tabu (1931) with documentary film pioneer Robert J. Flaherty, who left after artistic disputes with Murnau, who had to finish the movie on his own. A week prior to the opening of the film Tabu, Murnau died in a Santa Barbara hospital from injuries he had received in an automobile accident that occurred along the Pacific Coast Highway near Rincon Beach, southeast of Santa Barbara. Only 11 people attended his funeral. Among them were Robert J. Flaherty, Emil Jannings, Greta Garbo and Fritz Lang, who delivered the eulogy.Of the 21 films Murnau directed, eight are considered to be completely lost.In July 2015 Murnau's grave was broken into, the remains disturbed and the skull removed by persons unknown. Wax residue was reportedly found at the site, leading some to speculate that candles had been lit, perhaps with an occult or ceremonial significance. As this disturbance was not an isolated incident, the cemetery managers are considering sealing the grave."

He began by making several short films which paved the way for his brilliant television films of the 1960s that are acclaimed for his attention to detail and opulent visuals.

In 1955, aged 22, Williams moved to England and joined fellow Canadian George Dunning's company T.V. Cartoons Ltd., working primarily on television commercials.

Though a critical success it received a mixed response at the box office. Consequently, his next venture was aimed at the mainstream market. Love Me, Love Me, Love Me (1962) turned out to be a commercial success and generated enough revenue for Williams to set up his own animation studio. In addition to producing commercials, Williams went on to create memorable title sequences for motion pictures, including Ciao Pussycat (1965), S.S.S. sicario servizio speciale (1965), La spia dal naso freddo (1966), La pantera rosa colpisce ancora (1975) and La pantera rosa sfida l'ispettore Clouseau (1976).

19254,3433,"The illegitimate son of a Danish farmer and his Swedish housekeeper, Carl Theodor Dreyer was born in Copenhagen on the 3th of February, 1889. He spent his early years in various foster homes before being adopted by the Dreyers at the age of two. Contrary to popular belief (perhaps nourished by the fact that his films often deal with religious themes) Dreyer did not receive a strict Lutheran upbringing, but was raised in a household that embraced modern ideas: in his spare time the adoptive father was an avid photographer, and the Dreyers voted for The Danish Social Democrates. When he was baptized the reasoning was culturally, not religiously motivated. Dreyer's childhood was an unhappy one. He did not feel his adoptive parents' love (especially the mother), and longed for his biological mother, whom he never knew.After working as a journalist, he entered the film industry, and advanced from reading scripts to directing films himself. In the silent era his output was large, but it quickly diminished with the arrival of the talkie. In his lifetime he was recognized as being a fanatical perfectionist amongst producers, and thus difficult to work with. His career was dogged by problems with the financing of his films, which led to large gaps in his output "

1235166,2191,"Born in Paris, France, in 1952. Jacques Audiard's family has always been involved in movie business. His father, Michel, was a popular screenwriter and director and his uncle a producer. But in his teens he refused that world and wanted to be a teacher. He studied literature and philosophy at the Sorbonne but didn't finish his degree. By that time, his then girlfriend suggested he work as a trainee editor during his university holidays. He worked as an assistant editor on several movies like ""Le locataire"" (1976) directed by Roman Polanski.He also joined a theater where he did all kinds of work. He specially enjoyed adapting works for stage. In the eighties he wrote the screenplays of some successful movies like ""Mortelle Randonnee"" (1983), ""Reveillon Chez Bob"" (1984), ""Saxo"" (1987), ""Frequence meurtre"" (1988) and ""Grosse fatigue"" (1994). Most of those films were thrillers directed by prestigious filmmakers like Claude Miller and Michel Blanc. He also directed some well received short movies.Thanks to the success of those movies he was able, in 1994, to raise up the money to make his first movie ""Regarde les hommes tomber"" a somber road movie starred by two of the most important French actors: Mathieu Kassovitz and Jean Louis Trintignant. That movie won 3 Cesars of the French academy for best editing, best new director (Jacques Audiard) and best new actor (for Kassovitz).Kassovitz also became the star of his second movie ""Un heros tres discret"" released in the Festival de Cannes in 1996 where it won the award for best screenplay. ""Un heros tres discret"" undermined the myth of the French resistance to the Nazis by telling the story of a young impostor who rises high in French society after World war by concocting a past for himself as a hero. It also won awards in the festivals of Stockholm and Valladolid and made his name internationally.In 2001 he made his third movie ""Sur mes levres"". The love story between two outsiders (a deaf office worker and a hoodlum) who decide to con a group of gangsters also became a success. It also won three Cesars (best actress, sound and screenplay).His last movie, ""De battre mon Coeur sest arrête"" (a remake of ""Fingers"" a James Toback's movie) was released in the Berlin festival of 2005.With those movies, Audiard has become the new master of the ""polar"" (French thriller) and inheritor of others great French directors like Jean"
