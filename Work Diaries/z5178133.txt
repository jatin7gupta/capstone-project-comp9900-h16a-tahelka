Week 1
Group was formed online and we had our first meeting for an hour on the 16th of September. Went over our backgrounds, skills we were bringing to the table, project ideas and then voted on a project to pursue which was FilmFinder. Class lab meeting to discuss database choice, structure, clarifications. Assigned roles for the rest of the project. Planned to self-study about Jira and note down novel ideas to add on to the FilmFinder before our next meeting on the 19th of September. I created the latex outline for the project proposal in Overleaf and noted down over eight novel ideas of potential projects. Meeting on the 19th included finalizing project scope/novel idea/architecture. 


Week 2
Completed existing platforms research and finalized novelty of three concepts to be implemented for the project. Wrote out part of the project proposal. Found 3 databases to be combined to get all the information for our project. Coded a Jupiter notebook and then moved it to Google Collaborate since the processing power was not adequate to process on my computer but the Google Collab GPUs could not be used either since it was not a tensor flow operation. Had a discussion on 24th Sept lab 2 about how many users, movies etc we wanted to retain from the data sources due to limited processing power and how to structure it. 

Week 3
My task for the week is to complete my part of the proposal on MSteams, to help with user stories where possible and move entire report over to Overleaf and help with editing/submission by Lab3. Also to finish combining the three sources of the data.
