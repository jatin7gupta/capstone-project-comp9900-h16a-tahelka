Week 1

Found a group after a bit of searching.  Had a couple of group meetings where we
discussed possible project ideas, and settled on FilmFinder.  Found a couple of
useable datasets for movie data.  Discussed database design for the project and
more or less decided on a schema.  The plan for the coming week is to complete
about two thirds of the project proposal.
