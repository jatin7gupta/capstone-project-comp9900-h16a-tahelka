Week 1

Found a group after a bit of searching.  Had a couple of group meetings where we
discussed possible project ideas, and settled on FilmFinder.  Found a couple of
useable datasets for movie data.  Discussed database design for the project and
more or less decided on a schema.  The plan for the coming week is to complete
about two thirds of the project proposal.

Week 2

Entered user stories on Jira.  Made Project Objectives document, with FilmFinder
specification divided up into objectives and paired description points with
corresponding objectives points, for our convenience, as the similar but
non-identical 'Project Description' and 'Project Objectives' descriptions were
annoying.  Produced an initial software architecture diagram, then produced a
new version of the diagram that Jatin had drawn.  Updated some user stories on
Jira to conform to the 'Connextra' format.  With regard to the stories, was a
bit uncertain about whether we were breaking up the objectives sufficiently, so
emailed mentor for feedback.  The plan for the coming week is to complete the
project proposal.

Week 3

Did some more work on user stories on Jira.  Matched each project objective with
its corresponding user stories, for proposal, to justify that the stories
satisfy all the objectives.  Produced a new software architecture diagram after
discussion with our mentor revealed that the previous one didn't have the right
details in it.  Finalised database schema with Yash and made up some web
contracts between the API and the UI for the first sprint.  The project proposal
was completed and submitted.  The plan for the coming week is to complete the
first sprint, which includes user stories on authentication, searching for
movies by name and viewing a movie's full details.

Week 4

Began coding.  Worked primarily on code to allow a user to search for movies by name, to allow a user to view the full details of a movie, and to allow a user to leave a review for a movie, including testing and debugging.  The only thing from Sprint 1 that wasn't finished was a pair of User Stories on the recommendation system, which were probably a bit ambitious to have the first sprint, but are being worked on steadily.  The plan for the coming week is to complete the second sprint and to prepare for the first progressive demo.
