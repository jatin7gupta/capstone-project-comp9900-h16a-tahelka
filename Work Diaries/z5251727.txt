Week 1

Found a group after a bit of searching.  Had a couple of group meetings where we
discussed possible project ideas, and settled on FilmFinder.  Found a couple of
useable datasets for movie data.  Discussed database design for the project and
more or less decided on a schema.  The plan for the coming week is to complete
about two thirds of the project proposal.

Week 2

Entered user stories on Jira.  Made Project Objectives document, with FilmFinder
specification divided up into objectives and paired description points with
corresponding objectives points, for our convenience, as the similar but
non-identical 'Project Description' and 'Project Objectives' descriptions were
annoying.  Produced an initial software architecture diagram, then produced a
new version of the diagram that Jatin had drawn.  Updated some user stories on
Jira to conform to the 'Connextra' format.  With regard to the stories, was a
bit uncertain about whether we were breaking up the objectives sufficiently, so
emailed mentor for feedback.  The plan for the coming week is to complete the
project proposal.
