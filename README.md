# FilmFinder
## Project Description
People are often looking for movies to watch. In this project we call them FilmFinders. These
FilmFinders must be able to search for new movies to watch by keywords that can match on the name,
genre, or description of movies. The results that are provided must include the name and the latest
associated average rating for each movie. Naturally, these FilmFinders should then be able to select a
movie from these search results to view its full details. Here, the full details for a movie should include
its name, description, genre, director, cast, latest average rating, as well as all reviews that other
FilmFinders have left for this movie. Apart from searching for movies, FilmFinders may want to watch a
movie that is similar to one they've already seen. To help with this, FilmFinders should see a list of
recommended movies on the details page for a given movie that they want to find “similar” movies to.
These recommendations must be based on at least review history, and a selection of multiple attributes
that a user can select (eg: genre and/or director). Once a FilmFinder locates a movie they are
interested in, they must be able to add (and later remove) this movie to their "wishlist" of movies they'd
like to watch. FilmFinders must also be able to leave a review for any number of movies, where each
review is to also include a rating from 0 to 5. In further assisting FilmFinders with finding movies of
interest, they should be able to view the wishlist of the FilmFinder who has left any given review. They
must also be able to browse movies by director or genre, with movies sorted from most popular to least
popular based on the movie average rating, and movies with an equal rating being sorted alphabetically
(movies with no rating would be treated as having an average rating of 0). Finally, to avoid reviews from
authors a FilmFinder does not find credible, a FilmFinder must be able to add any review writer(s) they
wish to their "banned" list, meaning that the reviews written by the banned review writer(s) will not be
seen or influence the average rating for the FilmFinder who banned the review writer(s).

## Project Objectives
Film finders must be able to search for movies they are interested by keywords that match to the movie
name, description, or genre, with listed results showing matching movie names, and their latest
average rating. A film finder must be able to view the full details of any movie they come across on the
platform, including the movie name, description, genre, cast, director, latest average rating, and all
associated reviews. The full details page for a given movie must also show recommendations for other
movies that are "similar", where such recommendations must be based on at least review history, and a
selection of multiple attributes that a user can select (eg: genre and/or director). Film finders must be
able to add any movie they come across on the platform to a wishlist of movies they'd like to watch, and
must also be able to remove movies from this wishlist. A film finder must also be able to leave a review
for any given movie they browse to on the platform, where such a review includes text as well as a
rating from 0 to 5. Film finders must also be able to view the wishlist of any other film finder that has left
a review for a given movie. The platform must also allow film finders to browse movies by director or
genre, with movies sorted from most popular to least popular based on the movie average rating, and
movies with an equal rating being sorted alphabetically (movies with no rating would be treated as
having an average rating of 0). The platform must also allow film finders to add any review writer(s)
they wish to their "banned" list, meaning that the reviews written by the banned review writer(s) will not
be seen or influence the average rating for the FilmFinder who banned the review writer(s).
